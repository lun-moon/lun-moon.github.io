# Swift Exponentiation is super annoying.

`import Foundation`  
`let eight: Deicmal = pow(2,3)`  
`print(eight)`  
**`8`**

However do not try to  
`let eightWhoops: Int = pow(2,3)`   
**`error: cannot convert value of type 'Decimal' to specified type 'Int'`**  
**`let eight: Int = pow(2,3)`**  
**`                 ^~~~~~~~`**  
**`                 Int(    )`**  

Also the way to enter a new line in markdown is weird (two spaces at the end of the line).

And don't forget the automatic links style (http address in between `<>`).

Prob will be worth it to know this stuff though, yeah.
