#turns out flutter is already out for windows macos linux
<https://flutter.dev/desktop>

Funny little issue here as of today is that setting the window title on desktop currently seems to require a plugin... or maybe I need to spend more time examining the source to find a method to do this (as I just got started).

Window title is not a big deal as having the three major OS's apparently already supported for real functionality is great.
snap install for linux is easy too (do not be scared by the number of dependencies if installing via snap)
