# Getting started on Coding With Friends

[Mayuko (Engineer Youtuber)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEDkO7wshcDZ7UZo17rPkzQ) has started [Code With Friends Fall 2020](https://codewithfriends.io/faq).
Going to have to choose what I focus on for a CWFproject, like [Paul Hudson's SwiftUI in 100 Days](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) (which is why I have this blog)
Or learning web-app technologies like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

From Paul Hudson, I'm supposed to post something I learn each day so:
if you're running Ubuntu and install node/npm from the Ubuntu repo -> 
You're going to get EACCES errors when installing things globally ( -g switch ) because some system directories outside of your user directory will be involved in installation.
The workaround would be below (Manually change npmâ€™s default directory). This was needed for [Netlify setup](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#installation).
https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally


In any case it's going to be a good 30 days.
