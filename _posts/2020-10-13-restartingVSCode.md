# Visual Studio Code - Target of URI doesn't exist (for a flutter package)  
<https://stackoverflow.com/a/45339159> to apply this fix
1) `flutter pub get`  
2) restart vscode if error still shows, instead of using the file menu:  
Open the command palette ( Ctrl + Shift + P ) and execute the command: >Reload Window.  

On other Ctrl + Shift + P shortcuts, there is also a command to clear the VSCode terminal ; ctrl-l also works.
Becuase ctrl-a ctrl-k cannot be used to clear the terminal line, just alt-b to the start of the line then alt-d to delete all words
